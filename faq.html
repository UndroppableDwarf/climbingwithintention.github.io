      <div class="faq">
<p><strong>Do I need to be strong or athletic to start climbing?</strong><br>
    Not at all! You donâ€™t need any prior experience or strength. Whether itâ€™s your first time on the wall or youâ€™re returning after a break, everyone has a place to begin. Climbing is adaptable and weâ€™ll meet you where you are.</p>

    <p><strong>What should I bring to a session?</strong><br>
    Wear comfortable clothes that allow you to move freely and bring water. If you donâ€™t have your own climbing shoes, you can rent a pair at the gym. If youâ€™re not a member of the gym, youâ€™ll also need to pay for a day pass â€” prices are listed on <a href="https://www.bloc11.co.za/" target="_blank">Bloc 11â€™s website</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Where do sessions take place?</strong><br>
    Most sessions happen at Bloc 11 in Cape Town. If needed, we can discuss alternative gyms or even outdoor sessions depending on the season and your goals.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I book recurring sessions or get a package deal?</strong><br>
    Yes! You can book recurring sessions, and we offer discounted rates for packages â€” although this may depend on the coach you wish to book through, please feel free to contact them to enquire!</p>

    <p><strong>What if I'm scared of falling or failing?</strong><br>
    You're not alone â€” fear is a normal part of climbing. We'll take things at your pace. Coaching includes mindset support, helping you grow through fear, not avoid it.</p>

    <p><strong>What happens if I need to cancel?</strong><br>
    We have a 24-hour cancellation policy. If you cancel less than 24 hours before your session, the full fee still applies.</p>

    <p><strong>Can I train even if Iâ€™m injured or limited?</strong><br>
    Yes â€” as long as itâ€™s medically safe, we can adapt. Iâ€™ll help you train around injuries and focus on recovery, strength-building, or technique development, depending on whatâ€™s right for you.</p>
