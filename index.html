      <h2>Welcome to Climbing With Intention</h2>
<p>
  Climbing With Intention is more than just coaching ‚Äî it's a space for reflection, empowerment, and play. Whether you're a total beginner or pushing through mental, technical, or physical barriers, we're here to meet you where you are.
</p>

<p>
  We‚Äôre a coaching site for anyone who wants to take climbing more seriously and would like someone to guide them, hold them accountable, and help them grow through thoughtful movement, mindset shifts, and strength building in an efficient and safe manner.
</p>

<p>
  You don‚Äôt have to be strong or have big goals to benefit from coaching. You just need curiosity, a willingness to learn, and a love for movement.
</p>

<p>
  Our mission is to help people feel more confident in their bodies and build a sustainable, joyful relationship with climbing and movement throughout their daily lives.
</p>

<p>
  For now it is just me (Sean) who is available to book through this site. However, in the future, other aspiring coaches will become available on the site!
